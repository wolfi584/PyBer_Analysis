# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
For this challenge I am to create a summary data frame of ride sharing date grouped by city type. Next, applying my expertise of pandas and matplotlib I will create a graph revealing total weekly fares for each city type. After presenting my analysis, I will share a summary explaining how the information is unique by city type, and what these differences ultimatley mean for the decision makers at PyBer.

## Results
- Urban cities have a highest driver_count, the lowest fare per driver, and the highest total fares
- Suburbs have the second highest driver_count, the second highest fare per driver, and the second highest total fares
- Rural areas have the lowest driver_count, highest fare per driver, and the lowest total fares
- In the latter half of February 2019, fare totals increase for all three areas
- At the end of April 2019, total fare amounts decrease for rural and urban areas but increase for suburbia
