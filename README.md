# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
For this challenge I am to create a summary data frame of ride sharing date grouped by city type. Next, applying my expertise of pandas and matplotlib I will create a graph revealing total weekly fares for each city type. After presenting my analysis, I will share a summary explaining how the information is unique by city type, and what these differences ultimatley mean for the decision makers at PyBer.

## Results
- Urban cities have the highest driver_count, the lowest fare per driver, and the highest total fares
- Suburbs have the second highest driver_count, the second highest fare per driver, and the second highest total fares
- Rural areas have the lowest driver_count, highest fare per driver, and the lowest total fares
- In the latter half of February 2019, fare totals increased for all three areas
- At the end of April 2019, total fare amounts decreased for rural and urban areas but increased for suburbia

## Summary
### Recommendations addressing disparities
  - Increase the number of rides per driver in rural and suburban areas
  - Increase the distance per ride in urban areas 
  - Address these recommendations by adding to the PyBer marketing strategy. Target riders in cities wishing to travel longer distances, like to the airport. Aim to increase rides in rural and suburban areas by targeting locals wishing to travel shorter distances for ride sharing or recreational purposes.
